### Running Locally

**1. Clone**

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/pmariglia/foul-play.git`

**2. Install Requirements**

Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Note: Requires Rust to be installed on your machine to build the engine.

**3. Configure your [env](https://github.com/pmariglia/foul-play/blob/master/env) file**

Here is a sample:
```
BATTLE_BOT=safest
WEBSOCKET_URI=wss://sim3.psim.us/showdown/websocket
PS_USERNAME=MyUsername
PS_PASSWORD=MyPassword
BOT_MODE=SEARCH_LADDER
POKEMON_MODE=gen7randombattle
RUN_COUNT=1
```

**4. Run**

Run with `python run.py`

### Running with Docker

**1. Clone the repository**

`git clone https://github.com/pmariglia/foul-play.git`

**2. Build the Docker image**

Use the `Makefile` to build a Docker image
```shell
make docker
```

or for a specific generation:
```shell
make docker GEN=gen4
```

**3. Run with an environment variable file**
`docker run --env-file env foul-play:latest`

## Engine

This project uses [poke-engine](https://github.com/pmariglia/poke-engine) to search through battles.
See [the engine docs](https://poke-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.

The engine must be built from source if installing locally so you must have rust installed on your machine.

### Re-Installing the Engine

It is common to want to re-install the engine for different generations of Pokémon.

`pip` will used cached .whl artifacts when installing packages
and cannot detect the `--config-settings` flag that was used to build the engine.

The following command will ensure that the engine is re-installed properly:
```shell
pip uninstall -y poke-engine && pip install -v --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir poke-engine --config-settings="build-args=--features poke-engine/<GENERATION> --no-default-features"
```

Or using the Makefile:
```shell
make poke_engine GEN=<generation>
```

For example, to re-install the engine for generation 4:
```shell
make poke_engine GEN=gen4
```

## Battle Bots

The Battle Bot decides which algorithm to use to pick a move

### Monte-Carlo Tree Search
use `BATTLE_BOT=mcts`

Uses poke-engine to perform a
[monte-carlo tree search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) to determine the best move to make.

### Expectiminimax
use `BATTLE_BOT=minimax`

Uses poke-engine to perform an
[expectiminimax search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax) and picks the move that minimizes the loss
for the turn.

## Specifying Teams
You can specify teams by setting the `TEAM_NAME` environment variable.
Examples can be found in `teams/teams/`.

Passing in a directory will cause a random team to be selected from that directory.

The path specified should be relative to `teams/teams/`.

#### Examples

Specify a file:
```
TEAM_NAME=gen8/ou/clef_sand
```

Specify a directory:
```
TEAM_NAME=gen8/ou
```
